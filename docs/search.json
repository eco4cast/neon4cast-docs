    "text": "Introduction\n\n \n\nThe National Science Foundation funded Ecological Forecasting Initiative Research Coordination Network (EFI-RCN) is hosting a NEON Ecological Forecast Challenge with the goal to create a community of practice that builds capacity for ecological forecasting by leveraging NEON data products. The Challenge revolves around the five theme areas listed below that span aquatic and terrestrial systems, and population, community, and ecosystem processes across a broad range of ecoregions that uses data collected by NEON.\nAs a community, we are excited to learn more about the predictability of ecological processes by forecasting NEON data prior to its release. What modeling frameworks, mechanistic processes, and statistical approaches best capture community, population, and ecosystem dynamics? These questions are answerable by a community generating a diverse array of forecasts. The Challenge is open to any individual or team that wants to submit forecasts and includes categories for different career stages.\nThe design of the Challenge is the result of contributions of over 200 participants in the May 2020 virtual EFI-RCN meeting, including partner organizations, and the hard work from the Design Teams that have developed the protocols for each of the themes."

Additionally, forecasts of chlorophyll-a are invited for the 7 lakes and 3 non-wadeable river NEON sites.\nYou can chose to submit to either the lakes, rivers or streams or all three. You can also chose to submit any of the three focal variables (temperature, oxygen, and chlorophyll).\nTeams are asked to submit their 30-day forecasts of NEON surface mean daily surface water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and/or chlorophyll-a along with uncertainty estimates and metadata. NEON surface water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a collected prior to the current date will be provided and may be used to build and improve the forecast models. Other data can be used as long as teams provide access (minimum of URL, but ideally a script) to all teams in the challenge."

    "section": "1.3 Data: Targets",
    "text": "1.3 Data: Targets\nThe challenge uses the following NEON data products: - DP1.20264.001: Temperature at specific depth in surface water for lakes - DP1.20288.001: Water quality (includes oxygen and chlorophyll-a)\n- DP1.20035.001{target =“_blank”}: Temperature in surface waters for streams\nAdditionally, hourly water temperature profiles are also available for the lake sites, to aid model development, but will not be used in forecast scoring or evaluation. Only surface mean daily temperature forecasts should be submitted. Here is the format of the expanded targets data\n\n1.3.1 Surface Mean Daily Dissolved Oxygen Concentration\nDefinition\nDissolved oxygen (DO) is the concentration of oxygen dissolved in water. NEON’s 30-minute time resolution from deployed water quality sondes among the freshwater sites reports this concentration as mg L-1. We have adapted the available NEON DO data to output the mean daily DO concentration in mg L-1 from a water quality sonde(s) deployed in the top 1 m of the water column across all sites. Where multiple depths have observations within this depth range an average was taken. Common DO concentrations range between 0 and 12 mg L-1 and DO concentrations less than 2 mg L-1 are considered hypoxic.\nMotivation\nDissolved oxygen concentration is a critically important variable in limnology. Forecasts of dissolved oxygen in freshwaters is the first step to understanding other freshwater ecosystem processes. For example, oxygen serves as the gatekeeper to other biogeochemical reactions that occur as well as determine the variety and health of aquatic organisms present in rivers and lakes. Preemptive forecasts of dissolved oxygen concentrations can anticipate periods of high or low oxygen availability, thereby providing insight into how the ecosystem may change at relatively short timescales.\n\n\n1.3.2 Surface Mean Daily Water Temperature\nDefinition\nWater temperature is the temperature of the water. NEON’s 30-minute time resolution from deployed water temperature sondes in the freshwater sites reports this in degrees Celsius (°C). We have adapted the available NEON water temperature data to output the mean daily water temperature in °C from temperature thermisters deployed 0-1m below the water surface at the lake sites and a water temperature sonde deployed in the stream sites. Where multiple depths have observations within this depth range an average was taken. Common water temperatures in lakes and streams range between 4 and 35 °C.\nMotivation\nIn streams and rivers, forecasting water temperature can be meaningful for protecting aquatic communities while maintaining socio-economic benefits (Ouellet-Proulx et al. 2017). In lentic and lotic systems, successfully forecasting water temperatures can be important for management of fisheries and water utilities that rely on specific threshold temperatures (Zhu et al. 2020). Recently, lake temperature forecasts have been used to predict seasonal turnover, mixing bottom nutrients into the surface and impairing water quality.\n\n\n1.3.3 Chlorophyll-a\nDefinition\nchlorophyll-a (chla) is the concentration of chlorophyll-a in the water column, as measured using florescence. NEON’s 30-minute time resolution from deployed water quality sondes among the freshwater sites reports this concentration as mg L-1. We have adapted the available NEON chla data to output the mean daily chla concentration in mg L-1 from a water quality sonde deployed in the top 1 m of the water column at a lake sites and water quality sondes deployed in the non-wadeable river sites (BLWA, FLNT, TOMB). No ongoing measurements of chla are available in the wadeable streams and therefore cannot be forecasted in this challenge.\nMotivation\nPhytoplankton biomass are the base of the aquatic food-web and an important indicator of water quality for managers.\n\n\n1.3.4 Focal sites\nInformation on the sites can be found here:\n\nsite_data &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco4cast/neon4cast-targets/main/NEON_Field_Site_Metadata_20220412.csv\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(aquatics == 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsiteID\nsite name\nwaterbody type\nlatitude\nlongtitude\nNEON site URL\n\n\n\n\nARIK\nArikaree River NEON\nWadeable Stream\n39.75821\n-102.44715\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/arik\n\n\nBARC\nLake Barco NEON\nLake\n29.67598\n-82.00841\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/barc\n\n\nBIGC\nUpper Big Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n37.05972\n-119.25755\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/bigc\n\n\nBLDE\nBlacktail Deer Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n44.95011\n-110.58715\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/blde\n\n\nBLUE\nBlue River NEON\nWadeable Stream\n34.44422\n-96.62420\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/blue\n\n\nBLWA\nBlack Warrior River NEON\nNon-wadeable River\n32.54153\n-87.79815\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/blwa\n\n\nCARI\nCaribou Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n65.15322\n-147.50397\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/cari\n\n\nCOMO\nComo Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n40.03496\n-105.54416\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/como\n\n\nCRAM\nCrampton Lake NEON\nLake\n46.20967\n-89.47369\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/cram\n\n\nCUPE\nRio Cupeyes NEON\nWadeable Stream\n18.11352\n-66.98676\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/cupe\n\n\nFLNT\nFlint River NEON\nNon-wadeable River\n31.18542\n-84.43740\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/flnt\n\n\nGUIL\nRio Guilarte NEON\nWadeable Stream\n18.17406\n-66.79868\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/guil\n\n\nHOPB\nLower Hop Brook NEON\nWadeable Stream\n42.47194\n-72.32953\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/hopb\n\n\nKING\nKings Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n39.10506\n-96.60383\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/king\n\n\nLECO\nLeConte Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n35.69043\n-83.50379\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/leco\n\n\nLEWI\nLewis Run NEON\nWadeable Stream\n39.09564\n-77.98322\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/lewi\n\n\nLIRO\nLittle Rock Lake NEON\nLake\n45.99827\n-89.70477\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/liro\n\n\nMART\nMartha Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n45.79084\n-121.93379\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/mart\n\n\nMAYF\nMayfield Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n32.96037\n-87.40769\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/mayf\n\n\nMCDI\nMcDiffett Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n38.94586\n-96.44302\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/mcdi\n\n\nMCRA\nMcRae Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n44.25960\n-122.16555\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/mcra\n\n\nOKSR\nOksrukuyik Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n68.66975\n-149.14302\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/oksr\n\n\nPOSE\nPosey Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n38.89431\n-78.14726\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/pose\n\n\nPRIN\nPringle Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n33.37852\n-97.78231\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/prin\n\n\nPRLA\nPrairie Lake NEON\nLake\n47.15909\n-99.11388\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/prla\n\n\nPRPO\nPrairie Pothole NEON\nLake\n47.12984\n-99.25315\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/prpo\n\n\nREDB\nRed Butte Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n40.78393\n-111.79789\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/redb\n\n\nSUGG\nLake Suggs NEON\nLake\n29.68778\n-82.01775\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/sugg\n\n\nSYCA\nSycamore Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n33.75099\n-111.50809\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/syca\n\n\nTECR\nTeakettle Creek - Watershed 2 NEON\nWadeable Stream\n36.95593\n-119.02736\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/tecr\n\n\nTOMB\nLower Tombigbee River NEON\nNon-wadeable River\n31.85343\n-88.15887\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/tomb\n\n\nTOOK\nToolik Lake NEON\nLake\n68.63069\n-149.61064\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/took\n\n\nWALK\nWalker Branch NEON\nWadeable Stream\n35.95738\n-84.27925\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/walk\n\n\nWLOU\nWest St Louis Creek NEON\nWadeable Stream\n39.89137\n-105.91540\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/wlou"

    "text": "2.1 Overview\nThe exchange of water and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the land is akin to earth’s terrestrial ecosystems breathing rate and lung capacity. One of the best ways to monitor changes in the amount of carbon and water in an ecosystem is the eddy-covariance method. This method observes the net amount of carbon and water entering and exiting ecosystems at half-hourly timesteps, which is important because it can provide information on ecosystem processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration, their sensitivities to ongoing climate and land use change, and greenhouse gas budgets for carbon accounting and natural climate solutions. Forecasts of carbon uptake and release along with water use can provide insights into future production of food, fiber, timber, and carbon credits. Additionally, forecasts will highlight the influence that stress and disturbance have on carbon and water cycling."

    "text": "2.3 Data: Targets\nThe challenge uses the following NEON data products:\nDP4.00200.001: Bundled data products - eddy covariance\nA file with previously released NEON data that has been processed into “targets” is provided below. The same processing will be applied to new data that are used for forecast evaluation.\n\n2.3.1 Net ecosystem exchange\nDefinition\nNet ecosystem exchange (NEE) is the net movement of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ecosystem. At the 30-minute time resolution it is reported as \\(\\mu\\)mol CO2 m-2 s-1. At the daily time resolution it is reported as g C m-2 day-1. Negative values correspond to an ecosystem absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, positive values correspond to an ecosystem emitting CO2 to the atmosphere.\nMotivation\nNEE quantifies the net exchange of CO2 between the ecosystem and the atmosphere over that 30-minute or daily time period. Assessing skill at predicting 1/2 hourly - sub daily measurements provides more insight into ability to capture diel processes. The diel curve contains information on how plants and soil immediately respond to variations in meteorology.\nMaking daily predictions will allow us to rapidly assess skill and provide information in a timeframe pertinent to inform and implement natural resource management. It also allows for models that do not produce sub-daily estimates to participate\n\n\n2.3.2 Latent heat flux\nDefinition\nLatent heat flux is the movement of water as water vapor from the ecosystem to the atmosphere. It is reported as W m-2 (equivalent to J m-2 s-1). At the daily time resolution it is reported as mean W m-2. Positive values correspond to a transfer of water vapor from the ecosystem to the atmosphere.\nMotivation\nLatent heat measures the water loss from an ecosystem to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration (transpiration through plants + evaporation from surfaces).\nForecasting latent heat (evapotranspiration) can provide insights to water stress for plants and the efficiency that plants are using water relative to NEE, and to the amount of liquid water remaining in the soil for soil moisture forecasting\n\n\n2.3.3 Focal sites\nInformation on the sites can be found here:\n\nsite_data &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco4cast/neon4cast-targets/main/NEON_Field_Site_Metadata_20220412.csv\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(terrestrial == 1)\n\nwith full site table at the end of this page.\nThe distribution of sites across ecosystems types is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVegetation type\nCount\n\n\n\n\nEvergreen Forest\n4\n\n\nEvergreen Forest|Shrub/Scrub\n4\n\n\nDeciduous Forest|Evergreen Forest|Mixed Forest|Woody Wetlands\n3\n\n\nEvergreen Forest|Grassland/Herbaceous|Shrub/Scrub\n3\n\n\nGrassland/Herbaceous\n3\n\n\nCultivated Crops\n2\n\n\nDeciduous Forest|Evergreen Forest|Mixed Forest\n2\n\n\nDeciduous Forest|Evergreen Forest|Pasture/Hay\n2\n\n\nDeciduous Forest|Grassland/Herbaceous\n2\n\n\nDeciduous Forest|Mixed Forest|Woody Wetlands\n2\n\n\nDeciduous Forest|Pasture/Hay\n2\n\n\nShrub/Scrub\n2\n\n\nCultivated Crops|Deciduous Forest\n1\n\n\nCultivated Crops|Deciduous Forest|Evergreen Forest|Mixed Forest\n1\n\n\nCultivated Crops|Grassland/Herbaceous|Pasture/Hay\n1\n\n\nDeciduous Forest\n1\n\n\nDeciduous Forest|Evergreen Forest\n1\n\n\nDeciduous Forest|Woody Wetlands\n1\n\n\nDwarf Scrub|Evergreen Forest|Shrub/Scrub\n1\n\n\nDwarf Scrub|Shrub/Scrub\n1\n\n\nEmergent Herbaceous Wetlands\n1\n\n\nEmergent Herbaceous Wetlands|Evergreen Forest|Woody Wetlands\n1\n\n\nEmergent Herbaceous Wetlands|Grassland/Herbaceous\n1\n\n\nEvergreen Forest|Grassland/Herbaceous\n1\n\n\nEvergreen Forest|Shrub/Scrub|Woody Wetlands\n1\n\n\nEvergreen Forest|Woody Wetlands\n1\n\n\nGrassland/Herbaceous|Shrub/Scrub\n1\n\n\nPasture/Hay|Woody Wetlands\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 30-minute target data calculation\nTo create the data for evaluation (and training) for NEE and LE we extract NEE and LE that pass the turbulence quality control flags (qfqm.fluxCo2.turb.qfFinl = 0 ) provided by NEON and has flux values between -50 and 50 umol CO2 m-2 s-1.\n\n\n2.3.5 Daily target data calculation\nTo evaluate the models that produce daily flux forecasts, we select only days with at least 24 of 48 half-hours that pass the quality control flags. For these days, we average the half-hours and convert carbon to daily units (gC/m2/day)."

Density is defined as the total number of individuals caught in a week across the forested plots divided by the total area sampled in the forested plots during the week. Densities are presented as ticks per 1600m^2, as 1600m^2 is the size of an individual NEON tick plot.\nMotivation\nWe chose to use the density of Amblyomma americanum nymphs for several reasons. The first is that Amblyomma americanum is a vector of multiple pathogens, many of which cause human disease, and a forecast for their abundance could aid decisions in public health and personal protective measures. For simplicity, we chose to focus on one species for the abundance challenge, and the Amblyomma americanum nymphs are the most abundant tick observed in the NEON data. Most ticks are observed in to forested plots, and by standardizing the data to density of ticks observed per unit effort in the forested plots, we hope to avoid forecasters predicting sampling effort. We scaled the density to be representative of ticks per plot, which is more interpretable than ticks per square meter. Also, tick drags occur every three weeks. By having the challenge be for forecasting every week, participants won’t have to predict which weeks drags occur.\n\n\n3.3.2 Focal sites\nInformation on the sites can be found here:\n\nsite_data &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco4cast/neon4cast-targets/main/NEON_Field_Site_Metadata_20220412.csv\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(ticks == 1)\n\nSee Table at end for more information on the sites\n\n\n3.3.3 Target data calculation\nTick drags occur every three weeks at the NEON sites used in this challenge. The sampling season at each site is determined by phenological milestones, beginning and ending within two weeks of green-up and senescence, respectively. The 1m^2 cloth is dragged for 160m (and at least 80m), and ticks are collected intermittently. They are then sent to a lab for taxonomic identification. Ticks are then identified by life stage and taxonomic rank. The target data is for Amblyomma americanum nymphs that were identified to the species level; i.e. ticks identified as being in the Amblyomma genus are not included."

    "text": "4.1 Overview\nPhenology has been shown to be a robust integrator of the effects of year-to-year climate variability and longer-term climate change on natural systems (e.g., recent warming trends). Experimental studies have shown how other global change factors (e.g., elevated CO2 and N deposition) can also influence phenology. There is a need to better document biological responses to a changing world, and improved phenological monitoring at scales from individual organisms to ecosystems, regions, and continents will contribute to achieving this goal.\nPhenology researchers often use digital cameras (such as those that are part of the PhenoCam Network) that take regular repeated images of plant canopies to monitor changes in greenness and redness throughout the year. The PhenoCam Network is a cooperative continental-scale phenological observatory that uses digital repeat photography to track vegetation phenology in a diverse range of ecosystems across North America and around the World. Imagery and data are made publicly available in near-real-time through the PhenoCam webpage: http://phenocam.nau.edu/."

Adding rcc to the autumn forecast challenge has two motivations. First, from an end-user’s perspective the timing of peak fall coloration has aesthetic value, which translates into economic for tourism. Second, from the ecological perspective, autumn phenology involves two distinct (but coupled) processes, senescence (loss of leaf chlorophyll and photosynthetic activity; translocation of nutrients) and abscission (actual leaf fall). Forecasting two indices helps us disentangle our ability to predict these two processes.\n\n\n4.3.3 Focal sites\nInformation on the sites can be found here:\n\nsite_data &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco4cast/neon4cast-targets/main/NEON_Field_Site_Metadata_20220412.csv\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(phenology == 1)\n\nwith full site table at the end of this page.\nThe distribution of sites across ecosystems types is:\n\n\n\n\n\nVegetation type\nCount\n\n\n\n\ndeciduous broadleaf\n15\n\n\nevergreen needleleaf\n11\n\n\ngrassland\n9\n\n\ntundra\n5\n\n\nagriculture\n3\n\n\nevergreen broadleaf\n2\n\n\nshrubland\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Target data calculation\nDigital cameras mounted above forests are pointed at the forest canopy. Images are collected every half hour.\nThe images are a set of pixels values in red, green, and blue color channels (RGB). A pixel value is an 8-bit digital number (DN). Because internal processing (including exposure control) and external factors affecting scene illumination (weather and atmospheric effects) both influence the retrieved RGB signature, we calculate a number of vegetation indices that are effective at suppressing this unwanted variation and maximizing the underlying phenological signal. Most important among these is the green chromatic coordinate (GCC), calculated as GCC = GDN / (RDN + GDN + BDN). The red chromatic coordinate (GCC) is calculated in a similar way.\nFor additional details, see Richardson et al. (2018) Scientific Data, and Richardson (2019) New Phytologist.\nPhenoCam data are processed and posted daily and the low latency of the PhenoCam data allows for a unique opportunity to evaluate forecasts in real-time.\nEach image has a defined “region of interest’ (ROI). An ROI is a set of pixels that isolates particular features in the image (i.e., a set of deciduous trees in a mixed forest). The ROI of the below top-of-canopy PhenoCams will be used to assess the forecasts’ accuracy. The mid-day (noon) mean GCC and GCC standard deviation for the ROI will be used for evaluation.\nAll data in the supplied file is available to build and evaluate models before submitting a forecast to challenge. Once new data becomes available, the data are appended to the existing file. Within the challenge scoring, only the new data are used to evaluate previously submitted forecasts."

    "text": "5.1 Overview\nBiodiversity monitoring is critical for understanding environmental quality, evaluating the sustainability of land-use practices, and forecasting future impacts of global change on ecosystems. Sentinel species give forewarning of environmental risk to humans, so are particularly useful for such monitoring and forecasting efforts because they can provide surrogates for other co-located components of biodiversity (Sauberer et al. 2004).\nGround beetles (Family: Carabidae) are appropriate candidates for biodiversity monitoring and ecological forecasting as they are well-studied sentinel species that are geographically widespread, and their community dynamics are particularly congruent with the diversity of other invertebrates (Holland 2002; Lundgren & McCravy 2011; Bousquet 2012; Hoekman et al. 2017). Therefore, monitoring carabid communities and forecasting changes in their species richness and abundance can be useful in studying edge effects and habitat quality (Magura 2002), conservation potential (Butterfield 1995), land-use sustainability (Pearce & Venier 2006) and biodiversity change in response to global change and ecological disturbances (Koivula 2011). Most ecological forecasting models are limited in the geographic scale and also suffer from scarcity of temporally extensive data. Further, most existing forecasting efforts focus on a single species (Humphries et al. 2018) with limited community-wide forecasts at the continental scale. Developing forecasts for community-scale metrics (i.e., species richness, abundance) and evaluating such models for accuracy and generalizability can help test our scientific knowledge of spatial (geographical turnover) and temporal (seasonal, inter-annual) carabid community dynamics (Dietze et al. 2018). Such forecasting models can inform regional or local habitat management, identify where biodiversity monitoring efforts should be prioritized, and shed light on what data or modelling techniques are needed to build the best forecasts of ecological dynamics (e.g., can we predict richness or abundance better and why?) (Johansson et al. 2019).\nWith the long-term, community-wide, continental-scale data collection through the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), 181 data products are available for 81 sites in the US (47 terrestrial, at which carabids are sampled, and 34 aquatic). Fully initiated in 2019, this sampling will continue for 30 years (Schimel et al. 2007; 2011). NEON has effectively removed the previous barriers to community-scale forecasting across a broader geographical realm."

    "text": "5.2 Challenge\nThis is an open ecological forecasting challenge to forecast carabid species richness, defined as the total number of species, and abundance, defined as the total number of carabid individuals. The forecasts should be done weekly per site for all NEON terrestrial sites with richness being absolute and abundance scaled by the sampling effort. NEON releases carabid sampling data weekly and no sooner than 60 days after collection, so a model submitted on June 30 can include a forecast for the first week of May, and so forth. Teams may use any open data products as drivers of richness and abundance so long as they are not from the month being forecast, and are made publicly available (minimum of URL, but ideally a script). Potential driver data sources include: NEON site data (Soil and sediment data, Terrestrial Plant data, weather data), NOAA forecasts, and beyond."

    "section": "5.3 Data: Targets",
    "text": "5.3 Data: Targets\nThe challenge uses the following NEON data product:\nDP1.10022.001: Ground beetles sampled from pitfall traps\nForecasts will be made on a weekly basis for the abundance of beetles at a given NEON site at a given month (‘abundance’) and the observed species richness (n, number of species) of carabid beetles at each NEON site, each month.\n\n5.3.1 Abundance of beetles (abundance)\nDefinition\nTotal number of carabid individuals per trap-night, estimated each week of the year at each NEON site\nMotivation\nA forecast prediction can be compared against only measured data (i.e. counts) and not latent variables (i.e. true carabid abundance), which are only inferred under specific model assumptions. However, raw count of beetles found in a particular trap depends on many other drivers than local abundance; in particular, the sampling effort. To avoid the need to accurately predict the sampling effort, we compute a target variable as counts per trap-night (number of nights each trap was set at the site; also called ‘catch per unit effort’). We chose this to define this variable in terms of total carabid abundance, rather than resolving to particular taxonomy (in contrast to species-specific relative abundance) because it simplifies issues related to taxonomic resolution of unpinned samples, data latency, and the choice of focal species. As supported by literature (Hoekman et al. 2017 and literature cited therein), we believe that abundance of the beetle family as a whole is an ecologically relevant metric. We considered predictions aggregated to the site level (rather than predicting individual traps or individual plots) to be both the most ecologically meaningful and simplest choice. Traps are typically collected every two weeks. Submitting a forecast for every week avoids the need to predict which weeks of the year collection does or does not occur.\n\n\n5.3.2 Species richness (n)\nDefinition\nTotal number of unique ‘species’ in a sampling bout for each NEON site each week. For this challenge, we define ‘species’ as the taxonomic unit closest to species (e.g., species, genus, morphospecies) for each individual since not all identifications in the raw data are strictly at species-level.\nMotivation\nA forecast prediction can be compared against only measured data (i.e. observation count of taxonomic units) and not latent variables (i.e. count of species), which are only inferred under specific model and taxonomic assumptions. The number of unique taxonomic identities of beetles in a trap depends on many drivers, including sampling effort. As demonstrated by species rarefaction curves in ecology, the more time a trap is left out, the more individual beetles will fall in, and thus the more species can be expected. However, since perfect species-level data are not available to us and to keep the forecasted variables from being overly derived, we define the target variable as the total number of unique ‘species’ per week per NEON site. For this challenge, we chose to define ‘species’ as the taxonomic unit closest to species (e.g., species, genus, morphospecies) since not all identifications in the raw data are strictly at species-level. Species identifications will be used for individuals identified to sub-species level, as these are uncommon in the raw data. NEON taxonomists identify individuals as morphologically distinct units. Thus, it is reasonable to assert that the count of finest morphologically distinct identification (e.g., species, genus, morphospecies) is biologically meaningful, and thus the count of these is an important focal forecast variable. We focus on the NEON site as the spatial resolution and weekly intervals as the temporal resolution for the same reasons stated in the abundance metric.\n\n\n5.3.3 Focal sites\nAll 47 NEON terrestrial sites are included\nInformation on the sites can be found here:\n\nsite_data &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco4cast/neon4cast-targets/main/NEON_Field_Site_Metadata_20220412.csv\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(beetles == 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsiteID\nsite name\nvegetation type\nlatitude\nlongtitude\nNEON site URL\n\n\n\n\nABBY\nAbby Road NEON\nEvergreen Forest|Grassland/Herbaceous|Shrub/Scrub\n45.76244\n-122.33032\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/abby\n\n\nBARR\nUtqiaġvik NEON\nEmergent Herbaceous Wetlands\n71.28241\n-156.61936\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/barr\n\n\nBART\nBartlett Experimental Forest NEON\nDeciduous Forest|Evergreen Forest|Mixed Forest\n44.06389\n-71.28737\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/bart\n\n\nBLAN\nBlandy Experimental Farm NEON\nDeciduous Forest|Pasture/Hay\n39.03370\n-78.04179\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/blan\n\n\nBONA\nCaribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed NEON\nDeciduous Forest|Evergreen Forest|Mixed Forest|Woody Wetlands\n65.15401\n-147.50258\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/bona\n\n\nCLBJ\nLyndon B.

site every two weeks throughout the sampling season. The sampling season is defined based on measures of growing season, including vegetation indices, phenology, and degree days, for a maximum of 13 bouts per site during which the 10-day average low temperature at the site is &gt;4°C.\nSamples are collected from pitfall traps placed at each of the cardinal directions within the 10 plots per site representative of up to three dominant vegetation types. Four traps were placed from 2014-2017 and from 2018 onward the northward plot was eliminated leaving three traps for each plot. Ground beetles from the pitfall traps are removed, sorted, and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic rank or morphospecies. A subset of individuals (up to 467 per site and year) are sent to taxonomic experts for subsequent identification with priority on individuals for which species-level identification was not able to be assigned. Further detail can be found in the NEON Ground Beetle User Guide.\nRaw (NEON L1 ground beetle data product DP1.10022.001) are accessible via the NEON data portal, via the NEON API, via R using the neonUtilties package, and via R using neonStore::neon_download. The raw data is also available through the NEON data portal with archived copies at https://data.ecoforecast.org/minio/neonstore.\nThe raw data is processed to generate total abundance and richness per week per NEON site. All data in the supplied file is available to build and evaluate models before submitting a forecast to challenge. Once new data becomes available, the data are appended to the existing file. Within the challenge scoring, only the new data are used to evaluate previously submitted forecasts.\nAs part of our reproducible workflow, we provide an R script for producing derived tables of total abundance and richness from the raw NEON data. Our workflow gives preference to expert taxonomist identifications when available. Since expert taxonomy lags behind identifications from the sorting and pinning process, newer data will not be updated with expert taxonomy. The abundance table gives total abundance at each site for each week. The richness table gives an aggregate count of the number of ‘species’ at each site in each week."

    "section": "6.1 Scoring Metric: Continuous Ranked Probability Score",
    "text": "6.1 Scoring Metric: Continuous Ranked Probability Score\nForecasts will be scored using the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), a proper scoring rule for evaluating forecasts presented as distributions or ensembles (Gneiting & Raftery 2007). The CRPS compares the forecast probability distribution to that of the validation observation and assigns a score based on both the accuracy and precision of the forecast. We will use the ‘crps_sample’ function from the scoringRules package in R to calculate the CRPS for each forecast.\nWe will generate a combined score for all locations and forecast horizons. Forecasts will also be evaluated using the CRPS at each time-step in the forecast horizon and each location included in the forecasts.\nImportantly, we use the convention for CRPS where zero is lowest and best possible score, therefore teams want to achieve the lowest score. CPRS can be also expressed as a negative number with zero as highest and best possible score (Gneiting & Raftery 2007). The scoringRules package that we use follows the 0 or greater convention.\n\n6.1.1 Example of a CRPS calculation from an ensemble forecast\nThe following uses Equation 2 in Jordan, Kruger, and Lerch 2018\n\n\n\nEquation 1 from Jordan, Kruger, and Lerch 2018.\n\n\nFirst, create a random sample from a probability distribution. This is the “forecast” for a particular point in time. For simplicity, we will use a normal distribution with a mean of 8 and standard deviation of 1\n\nx &lt;- rnorm(1000, mean = 8, sd = 1.0)\n\nSecond, we have our data point (i.e., the target). We will set it to zero as well\n\ny &lt;- 8\n\nNow calculate CRPS using Equation 2\n\ns &lt;- 0\nfor(i in 1:length(x)){\n  for(j in 1:length(x)){\n    s &lt;- s + abs(x[i] - x[j])\n  }\n}\ncrps_equation_2 &lt;- mean(abs(x - y)) - s / (2 * length(x)^2)\ncrps_equation_2\n\n[1] 0.2400933\n\n\nNow calculate using the crps_sample() function in the scoringRules package\n\ncrps_sample(y = y, dat = x)\n\n[1] 0.2400933\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Exploring the scoring surface\nNow lets see how the CRPS changes as the mean and standard deviation of the forecasted distribution change\nFirst, set vectors for the different mean and SD values we want to explore\n\nsample_mean &lt;- seq(4, 12, 0.1)\nsample_sd &lt;- seq(0.1, 10, 0.1)\n\nSecond, set our observed value to 8 for simplicity\n\ny &lt;- 8\n\nNow calculate the CRPS at each combination of forest mean and SD\n\ncombined &lt;- array(NA, dim = c(length(sample_mean), length(sample_sd)))\nfor(i in 1:length(sample_mean)){\n  for(j in 1:length(sample_sd)){\n    sample &lt;- rnorm(10000, sample_mean[i], sample_sd[j])\n    combined[i, j] &lt;- crps_sample(y = y, dat = sample)\n  }\n}\n\nFinally, visualize the scoring surface with the observed value represented by the red line\n\ncontour(x = sample_mean, y = sample_sd, z = as.matrix(combined),nlevels = 20, xlab = \"Mean\", ylab = \"SD\")\nabline(v = y, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nThe contour surface highlights the trade-off between the mean and standard deviation.\n\n\n6.1.3 CRPS from the Normal Distribution\nIf the distributional forecast is a normal distribution represented by a mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), an ensemble of predictions is not needed to evaluate CRPS because we can take advantage of the analytic solution to CRPS under the normal assumption (Equation 4 from Gneiting et al. 2005)\nEquation 5 from Gneiting et al. (2005) gives\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nCRPS(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) | y) = \\sigma \\left( \\frac{y - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\left( 2 \\Phi\\left(  \\frac{y - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) - 1 \\right)  + 2 \\phi \\left(  \\frac{y - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\right)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nfor \\(\\Phi(\\cdot)\\) and \\(\\phi(\\cdot)\\) the standard normal CDF and PDF, respectively. Therefore, if the forecast distribution is truly a normal distribution (often this isn’t true in forecasts that only report a mean and sd) a simplified score can be applied as follows:\n\nsample_mean &lt;- seq(4, 12, 0.1)\nsample_sd &lt;- seq(0.1, 10, 0.1)\n\ncombined_norm &lt;- array(NA, dim = c(length(sample_mean), length(sample_sd)))\nfor(i in 1:length(sample_mean)){\n  for(j in 1:length(sample_sd)){\n    combined_norm[i, j] &lt;- crps_norm(y = y, mean = sample_mean[i], sd = sample_sd[j])\n  }\n}\n\nFinally, visualize the scoring surface with the observed value represented by the red line.\n\ncontour(x = sample_mean, y = sample_sd, z = as.matrix(combined_norm), nlevels = 20, xlab = \"Mean\", ylab = \"SD\")\nabline(v = y, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nNote that at a given value of the sd, the lowest score is achieved at \\(\\mu = y\\) as shown for each of the blue lines where the minimum value of the score across each blue line is at the red line. This behavior makes sense because the CRPS is a score that rewards accuracy and precision. Thus, for any given level of precision (represented by the standard deviation), CRPS is optimized by producing the most accurate prediction of the distribution’s location.\n\ncontour(x = sample_mean, y = sample_sd, z = as.matrix(combined_norm), nlevels = 20, xlab = \"Mean\", ylab = \"SD\")\nabline(v = y, col = \"red\")\nabline(h = 2.5, col = \"blue\")\nabline(h = 4.3, col = \"blue\")\nabline(h = 6.8, col = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, for a given mean \\(\\mu \\neq y\\) we find a pattern that makes intuitive sense given the goal of CRPS to produce forecasts that are both accurate and precise. For a given amount of bias in the prediction (i.e., given a \\(\\mu \\neq y\\)), the optimal score is achieved by a standard deviation that slightly larger than the bias.\n\nlayout(matrix(1:4, 2, 2, byrow = TRUE))\n## plots for mu = 7\nmu &lt;- 7\ncontour(x = sample_mean, y = sample_sd, z = as.matrix(combined_norm), nlevels = 20, xlab = \"Mean\", ylab = \"SD\", main = paste0(\"CRPS contour given mu = \", mu))\nabline(v = mu, col = \"red\")\nmin_sd &lt;- sample_sd[which.min(crps_norm(y, mean = mu, sd = sample_sd))]\nabline(h = min_sd, col = \"blue\")\nplot(sample_sd, crps_norm(y, mean = mu, sd = sample_sd), type = 'l', main = paste0(\"CRPS profile given mu = \", mu))\nabline(v = min_sd, col = \"blue\")\n## plots for mu = 11\nmu &lt;- 11\ncontour(x = sample_mean, y = sample_sd, z = as.matrix(combined_norm), nlevels = 20, xlab = \"Mean\", ylab = \"SD\", main = paste0(\"CRPS contour given mu = \", mu))\nabline(v = mu, col = \"red\")\nmin_sd &lt;- sample_sd[which.min(crps_norm(y, mean = mu, sd = sample_sd))]\nabline(h = min_sd, col = \"blue\")\nplot(sample_sd, crps_norm(y, mean = mu, sd = sample_sd), type = 'l', main = paste0(\"CRPS profile given mu = \", mu))\nabline(v = min_sd, col = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\nNext, we plot the relationship between a given value of \\(\\mu\\) and the \\(\\sigma\\) that produces the optimal CRPS. This looks like a linear relationship.\n\noptimal_sd &lt;- rep(0, length(sample_mean))\nfor (i in 1:length(sample_mean)) {\n  optimal_sd[i] &lt;- sample_sd[which.min(crps_norm(y, mean = sample_mean[i], sd = sample_sd))]\n}\nplot(sample_mean, optimal_sd, type = 'l')\n\n\n\n\nLet’s estimate the slope of the relationship. It looks like the optimal \\(sd\\) for a normal distribution forecast that is biased by \\(|y - \\mu|\\) is \\(sd = 1.2|y - \\mu|\\) which makes sense as this would put the true value in a region of high probability.\n\ncoef(lm(optimal_sd[sample_mean &gt; 0] ~ sample_mean[sample_mean &gt; 0]))\n\n                 (Intercept) sample_mean[sample_mean &gt; 0] \n                2.430864e+00                -1.478665e-16"

    "text": "10.7 Is it possible to automate my forecast submissions?\nYes. There are many ways to automate scripts that are written to download observations and meteorology drivers, generate forecasts, and submit forecasts. Two tools that many have used are cron jobs (see the R package cronR) that execute tasks at user specifics times and github actions. See more at Frequently Asked Questions\nCron jobs work on Unix and Mac systems. An example of a script that executes a cron job using R can be found here."

Each year will be a new round where we revise the rules (if necessary) and add new Themes. Your feedback on the Challenge will be critical to revising and clarifying the rules and information about the Challenge."

    "text": "10.9 Are there certain types of models that I need to use?\nNo, you can use any type of model, including empirical and process-based models. The only requirement is that your forecast includes uncertainty. The uncertainty can be represents using different model runs (ensemble members) or the statistics of the forecast (mean and standard deviation)."

How should I register to do this?\nEach new model needs its model metadata with a different model name (model_id). If the team submitting the multiple models is the same across models then you only need to complete the registration form once to define your team name.\nOverall, a team needs to complete the registration form us. Then they need to complete the separate model metadata for each model they submit. One team can have model_ids"
